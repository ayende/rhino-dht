* background replication!
* Backup handoff strategy
* master replication
* update topology every 30 minutes

* Fairness monitor:
	* distribute the backup responsability to all nodes
	* distribute segments fairly across all nodes
	
* Is Alive monitor
	* Clear assignments to take over a segment
	* Detect if node is down for extended period of time
	
* When topology change see if replication failure for assigning segment will remove the SeeOther restriction
* MasterSelectionStrategy (low priority)
